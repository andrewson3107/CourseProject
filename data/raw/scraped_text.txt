Join Kona as a Software Engineer.Kona - mental health for remote teams.Our founding team bonded over prior bad experiences with remote work. A terrible manager. A failed startup. A summer of burnout.We knew work could be better, healthier, and happier. So we turned to experts to learn what makes remote work hard. We've interviewed 800+ leaders since January 2020.Their pain was loud and clear. Remote teams are built on trust. But it’s difficult to build relationships and understand how everyone feels without meeting face-to-face.‍We built Kona to help remote workers fight burnout and build connections without changing how they work. We empower leaders to support their teams where they need it most.[https://www.heykona.com/]To us, empathy and wellbeing at work aren't just an add-on. They're a must-have. Today, Kona is trusted by 200+ people-first remote teams around the globe.We're making empathy mainstream at work. We’ve been through Techstars, and have raised $1M from top investors like Kleiner Perkins (early investors in Google, Uber, Airbnb etc.), Spencer Rascoff (founder/CEO of Zillow), Jeff Wilke (CEO of Amazon retail), The Fund, Overton VC, MiLA Capital, Rough Draft Ventures, Dorm Room Fund, and more.Our customers are the most culture-focused companies in the world - Outreach.io, GoodRx, Greenhouse.io, CoffeeMeetsBagel, Aircall and more.[https://www.builtinla.com/2020/12/07/sike-insights-1m-preseed-funding-hiring]People love Kona, use it every day, and get value out of it. Check out our case studies for more on how Kona drives mental health for teams.

Kona is only as strong as the team is, and meaningless without the overall wellbeing of everyone. We will ALWAYS prioritize this. And it’s okay to not be okay - we see vulnerability as a strength.Keep it SimpleWe keep it simple, stupid. We avoid buzzwords, and have a virtual buzzword jar to ensure we don’t get carried away in Silicon Valley hype. By design, we avoid excessive perfectionism.
