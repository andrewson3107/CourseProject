(Typescript)GraphQL as our API languageRuby/Sorbet+Sidekiq+ActiveRecord for backend business logicPostgreSQL for backend data persistenceRealm as our mobile DBNext StepsThe next step would be to complete the Project-Based assessment on the Hatchways Platform. Working at CanixOur development process is simple: identify an opportunity to make it easier for our customers to run their business (be it a product, infrastructure improvement, or development tool), run it by the team, and build it. We use daily check-ins to hold each other accountable, weekly meetings to plan the next cycle of work, and 3 month check-ins to talk about the company's priorities and goals as a whole. Everything else is up to you.Our technical challenges (and accomplishments) include:Integrating with hardware (e.g. wireless scale integrations for weighing product during and after harvest/processing or RFID scanners for plant tracking).Working with gnarly 3rd-party APIs to push/pull data to/from our backend with a high degree of accuracy and timeliness.Delivering beautiful and effective UIs to help our customers accomplish their work (some of our customers have not used a smartphone before).Writing efficient mobile applications that can work both online and offline to process hundreds of thousands of plant changes in sporadic network conditions.Managing payments for an often overlooked population of underbanked customers: the entire cannabis supply chain.About CanixCanix is on a mission to bring clarity and connection to the cannabis industry.
